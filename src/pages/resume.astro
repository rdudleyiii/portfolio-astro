  <div class="mb-5 text-justify">
    With over 12 years of expertise in UX, I have mastered an array of tools and
    methodologies to deliver superior user experiences. I'm at my best in
    environments where technology and users intersect. In my journey, I've
    created a framework for UX practices, implementing comprehensive design
    systems, and instilling key user testing and design principles in our
    research and design team. I further built upon this foundation through
    uncovering business needs and mapping them to our product outcomes that
    address requirements of designers, engineers, and other stakeholders.
