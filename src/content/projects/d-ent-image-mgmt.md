### High Points

- Major focus on utilizing the design system and established patterns.
- Incorporated in-browser image editing to increase throughput of the publishing team.
- Reduced the overall time in process from approximately 8 days to approximately 2 days.

Worked with developers to implement and refine the addition of an image cropping and editing tool in-browser so the publishers could stay in the web app to claim the items worked on, edit those items as needed, and submit for approval and final publishing to dillards.com.

This project started with some contextual inquiries at the photo studio. We dug deep into the whole function of the studio to uncover 17 different touchpoints where an image was being manually downloaded and uploaded. I worked with a UX Researcher to review the myriad non-value added activities and together with the development team, we designed a new process to streamline the work needed to publish items to the eCommerce site. Additionally, adding in familiar keyboard shortcuts to the web app reduced the training time for new users.

A rewarding part of this process was seeing the overall business impact once it was launched. The reduction in turn around allowed Dillard's to sell new products faster which, overall, was a great benefit to the bottom line.
