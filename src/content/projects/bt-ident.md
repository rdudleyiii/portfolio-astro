### Opportunity

The design system output was a key cog in delivering Identity Security Insights. While this was a quick MVP to surface actionable data, the foundation was implemented to leverage design system updates with minimal impact to sprint planning. This product was a key playing in surfacing the data that helped [discover the Okta breach in October 2023](https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/okta-support-unit-breach).

### Goals

- Work with engineering leads to coordinate and execute product updates to implement the single source solution
- Consolidate UI artifacts to provide customers with a streamlined, consistent experience

### Users

- Engineers
- Beta testing customers prior to General Availability rollout

### Business Impact

It was a goal for several years after consolidating 4 companies with different product expertise to unify our user experience, starting with general components, forms, and layouts. Numerous customer interviews mentioned the disconnect, so it was a high priority to start this new product with the user experience unification in mind.

### Metrics

- Number of engineering teams on-boarded and utilizing the design system
- Customer Satisfaction
- Satisfaction from Engineering, Product, and UX

### Deliverables and Key Activities

- Work withing engineering team to augment their sprint capacity to deliver
- Identify high priority needs from the new product to incorporate in the design system launch
