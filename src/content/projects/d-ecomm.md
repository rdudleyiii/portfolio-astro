### High Points

- Significant focus on improving accessibility scores
- Collaborated with developers and the constraints of the backend technology to deliver a more cohesive shopping experience.
- Cleaner, more minimal design to shift the focus to the product images rather than the widgets on the screen.

Worked within confines of the backend technology stack to product a more accessible and minimal design. Traditional black and white core theme as the concept was to let the product images speak for themselves without extra UI elements competing against them.

We utilized several testing tools (WCAG Compliance assessment, BrowserStack, accessibility scanner to determine the amount of A, AA, and AAA elements) to uncover quick fixes to address while establishing a plan to tackle the more involved findings.

Additionally, we started the running A/B tests of design items to see how it impacted engagement, conversion, and, overall, sales.
