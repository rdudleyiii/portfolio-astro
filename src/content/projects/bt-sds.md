3 facets of the design system: The guidelines, a styles package for developers, and an icons package to single source product icons across the product portfolio.

Team comprised of 3 developers, a QA, a UX writer, and a UI designer.

Guidelines help designers and developers understand the when and why of components, complete with live examples showcasing functionality.

Styles: allowed for quick onboarding of the design system. Boiled down to "add the npm package to your app, and you're ready to go"

Icons: single-sourced all icons within BeyondTrust products in an easy-to-use, easy-to-update npm package
