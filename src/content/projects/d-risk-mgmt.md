### High Points

- Stakeholder buy-in through continuous feedback.
- Designed for different levels of stress: "all is well", "spidy-sense is tingling", and "go now!"

The risk management project was one of the most rewarding experiences of my career. We were able to interview stakeholders, understand the needs of their team, and dive deep into the implications disasters, unexpected events, and other emergencies have on the physical stores.

We began with a major research initiative to uncover pain points with the current application. This yielded many design opportunities to streamline the experience, especially when in high-stress situations such as tornado or hurricane damage.

Following the research, we worked with the stakeholders to showcase the wireframes and high-fidelity screens as we made demonstrable progress.

Working in an Agile environment afforded us a quick feedback loop on the functionality that was built and shipped. The stakeholders loved the process and deliverable so much they catered a full breakfast celebration for the team on the initial production launch of the new system.
