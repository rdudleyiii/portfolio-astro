### Opportunity

The Password Safe project presented several opportunities for significant UX involvement. As it was in need of usability and accessibility improvements, the redesign work for this area of the product was substantial.

### Goals

- Achieve a better understanding of the pain points of the current experience
- Redesign the workflow and interface with greater insights and better technologies

### Users

- Password Safe customers and prospects
- Product Managers
- Engineering

### Business Impact

Sales for this product were lagging behind others, so reworking this pillar product to better fit the BeyondTrust style was seen to drive better sales opportunities with a more consistent and usable experience.

### Metrics

Validation of "mission critical" workflows through user testing (moderated and unmoderated)

### Deliverables and Key Activities

- To kick off our design research, I performed a heuristic review to identify potential "low-hanging fruit" which could be prioritized on the road map sooner than later.
- With the output from the heuristic evaluation, we had a good sense of the scale of our overhaul. We interviewed existing customers about the experience with the product to uncover anecdotal pain points.
- Wireframes of high-level user flow changes were created to validate concepts with Product and their long term aspirations for the product.
- A clickable prototype (Sketch x Craft x Invision) was used to test these workflow and interface upgrades with existing customers and prospects. A major win at this stage was getting engineers involved as observers in the "to-be" session.
- Worked with Product and Engineering to break down the scope of changes into deliverables for sprint planning
