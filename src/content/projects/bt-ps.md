The Password Safe project presented several opportunities for significant UX involvement. As it was in need of usability improvements and redesign, the work for this area of the product was substantial.

The image above shows the "current state" which was tested with users to uncover pain points.

### UX Process:

- Conducted an initial usability heuristic evaluation to identify the "low-hanging fruit."
- Interviewed several customers to uncover pain points with the current experience.
- Wireframed concepts for the revamped interface
- Validated technical feasibility with the product manager and developers before moving to high-fidelity designs.
- Created a clickable prototype (Sketch) with the high-fidelity designs
- Tested the prototype with customers to gauge improvement (major win to have developers participate as viewers during the research sessions!)
- Planned the implementation of the improvements with the Product Manger and Product Owner
