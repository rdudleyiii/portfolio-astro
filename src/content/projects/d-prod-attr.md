### High Points

- Established the foundation for the design system.
- Designed for a single product entry to scale to hundreds of potential attributes with hundreds of users.

Dillard's has well over 1,000,000 products on record so designed a system to incorporate this scale and the increasing volume of product attributes was a project that spanned a few years and culminated in a single system of record for all product data. Each product could potentially have hundreds of attributes

In this process, we worked with UX researchers to run a time study to gauge the efficiency and data quality of the new system. While there wasn't a dramatic decrease in time on task, the output and richness of the data was far greater and provided faster time to value for all areas of the business.

The key to this improvement was focusing on empowering the "Buyer" to craft the product data earlier in their process so all downstream systems could benefit from the data being in place.

The big UX win for the team was establishing foundational design patterns to be reused across other internal applications.
